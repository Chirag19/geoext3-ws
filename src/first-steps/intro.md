# First steps

Now that we know all the required [metainformation](../meta/intro.md) and have set up our [development environment](../meta/development-environment.md), it is time to get started.

In this chapter we will learn 5 things:

1. Where to save our [exercise HTML](hello-exercise.md) files
2. How to include [OpenLayers](hello-openlayers.md) in our exercise
3. How to include [ExtJS](hello-extjs.md) in our exercise
4. How to include [GeoExt](hello-geoext.md) in our exercise
5. Where to look for [more documentation](resources.md)
