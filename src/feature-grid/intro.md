# Feature grid

In this chapter we want to add a grid component to the application, which shows a row for every feature of a vector layer. We also want to add basic interaction between the grid of features and the map.

We will start in the usual way by setting up an ExtJS placeholder component which we will then gradually enhance or replace.

Head over to the [prepare layout chapter](prepare-layout.md), in which we'll add another visual component to our application.
