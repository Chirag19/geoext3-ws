# Summary

This chapter has taught you a lot:

* we learned how to create and use the `GeoExt.data.store.Features` class and configure it with a layer and a map
* we learned that such stores can be an in place replacement for Ext.data.Store, E.g. to display the contained data in a grid.
* We learned about `GeoExt.grid.column.Symbolizer` that can be used to render feature symbolizers in grids
* We also have seen how convenient it is to use eventlisteners to update the visual representation of your map (the `selectionchange` listener)

The next and final chapter will briefly introduce you to some [other GeoExt components](../other/intro.md).
