# Summary

This chapter has taught you a lot:

* We learned how to create and use the `GeoExt.data.store.Features` class and configure it with a layer and a map.
* We learned that such stores can be a replacement for `Ext.data.Store`, e.g. to display the contained data in a grid.
* We learned about `GeoExt.component.FeatureRenderer` that can be used to render feature symbolizers in a grid column.
* We also have seen how convenient it is to use event listeners to update the visual representation of your map (the `selectionchange` listener).

The next and final chapter will briefly introduce you to some [other GeoExt components](../other/intro.md).
