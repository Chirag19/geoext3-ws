# Other & summary

Congratulations! You've created a feature rich application with around 200 lines of JavaScript; and that includes plenty of comments and whitespace.

GeoExt still has more to offer.

We didn't have time to talk about [legends in the tree](http://rawgit.com/geoext/geoext3/master/examples/tree/tree-legend-simple.html), the super useful [`GeoExt.OlObject`-class](http://rawgit.com/geoext/geoext3/master/examples/mapviewform/mapviewform.html) or the [`PrintProvider`](http://rawgit.com/geoext/geoext3/master/examples/print/basic-mapfish.html) which allows you to serialize your map to a format understandable by the superb [Mapfish Print Servlet (v3)](http://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print-doc/#/overview).

Make sure to checkout all [examples](http://geoext.github.io/geoext3/), the [API documentation](https://geoext.github.io/geoext3/v3.0.0/docs/) (also available [with ExtJS-classes](https://geoext.github.io/geoext3/v3.0.0/docs-w-ext/)) and the [code on github](https://github.com/geoext/geoext3).

The source for this workshop is also [on github](https://github.com/geoext/geoext3-ws). If you find an error or outdated section, just open an issue or &mdash; even better &mdash; provide us with a pull request.

We hope you like what you have learned.
