# Popups, Overview & more

GeoExt has some more components and classes that we didn't touch so far. This chapter wants to show some other aspects of GeoExt. However, we cannot go through every class in detail and will only barely touch all the possibilities that GeoExt provides.

We will enhance our current application with two concrete usages of GeoExt functionality: an embedded overview-map and popups for hovered locations.

Furthermore we want to give a short theoretical outlook for possible enhancements of your applications. You can then explore these on your own.

Let's start with [adding popups](popups.md) for hovered coordinates, shall we?
