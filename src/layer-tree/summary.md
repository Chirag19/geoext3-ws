# Summary

This chapter taught you how to make use of the class `GeoExt.data.store.LayersTree` to create a tree showing the layers of the application.

The tree-panel correctly reorders the layer order in the map if the order changes (via drag and drop) in the tree. All tree-leafs have a checkbox to control the visibility of the connected layer.
