# Notes

In this section we want to keep certain notes about this workshop. It is **not a
necessary requirement** to read this section if you just start with GeoExt.

In case you have questions about *why* we have structured the workshop as we have
done it, please continue reading.

## Q: Why not as Ext.application? Why no MVC?

> Why didn't you create the examples as `Ext.application()`? And why aren't you using the MVC pattern?

We recommend the use of `Ext.application` / `Ext.app.Application` and the use of the MVC or MVVM pattern for real-world applications. For this introductory workshop we think this would complicate stuff more than necessary.

## Q: Why not with help of `Sencha Cmd`?

> Why don't you use the `Sencha Cmd` for the workshop?

We use the `sencha` tool quite often in our daily work, but found that the
additional burden of installation steps would be distracting for the main
focus of this workshop.
