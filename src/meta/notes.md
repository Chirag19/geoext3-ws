# Notes

This section contains various notes about this workshop. It is **not a
necessary requirement** to read this section if you are just starting with GeoExt.

If you have questions about *why* we structured the workshop the way we have, please continue reading.

## Q: Why not as Ext.application? Why no MVC?

> Why didn't you create the examples as `Ext.application()`? And why aren't you using the MVC / MVVM pattern?

We recommend the use of `Ext.application` / `Ext.app.Application` and the use of the MVC or MVVM pattern for real-world applications. For this introductory workshop we think this would make things more complicated than necessary.

## Q: Why no `Sencha Cmd`?

> Why don't you use the `Sencha Cmd` for the workshop?

We use the [`sencha` tool](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/)
quite often in our daily work, but found that the additional burden of
installation steps would be distracting for the main focus of this workshop.
