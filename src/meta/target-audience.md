# Target audience

This workshop is targeted at developers that want to try out the GeoExt library.

GeoExt is based on OpenLayers and ExtJS, so a bit of background in these
JavaScript libraries / frameworks doesn't hurt. It is not necessarily needed to
have a deep understanding of the base libraries, though. All examples or tasks
usually highlight the key aspects that make everything work together.

Some basic familiarity with JavaScript is assumed, but again, we will not dive
to deep into the language, so basically any interested person will be able
to understand what is going on.

In order to accomplish everything in the workshop, some OGC services (such as
WMS and WFS) will be used. We should provide you with enough written background
so you'll grasp the core of the tasks.

**Still unsure if you can work through this material?**

We strive to make this workshop as understandable as possible, so please try it
out! If you fail or experience problems, just tell us so: We are really looking
forward to getting feedback.
