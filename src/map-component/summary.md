# Summary

This chapter has shown you how to use the `GeoExt.component.Map`. We first started with a working example, that was the dissected in great detail. You have then learned how to configure your application by changing properties of OpenLayers-, ExtJS- and GeoExt-objects.

The next chapter will now introduce a component to deal with the possibly hierarchical structure of layers in the tree: we want to add a [layer-tree](../layer-tree/intro.md).
